Problem&Solution
1. There is no ID for Element So I used XPath instead
2. I Think there might be a Low Priority Bug but I’m not sure it’s a bug or not (May be it’s the requirement) >> On เข้าสู่ระบบ page, I need to click สมัครสมาชิก button 2 times to navigate to สมัครสมาชิก page successfully

Files
There are 3 files for Robot Framework
1. SearchFastwork.robot
2. SigninFastwork.robot
3. SignUpFastwork.robot

Remark
1. Actually, test cases and the Resource should be prepared separately but they aren't due to the time limitation
2. Moreover, There should be more test cases but i need more time to prepare both test case and test script. So, the test cases and test scripts that I prepared only included necessary cases.
